# Agent Guide

First-stop operating guide for agents working in this repository.

## Quick Scan

- `microbrowser` is a from-scratch native web browser in C++20, CMake, SDL3 for windowing only.
- Priority order: correctness → security → privacy → speed → CPU → memory → simplicity.
- **Every byte from the network and every message from a renderer is attacker-controlled.**
  Isolation is per *site*, not per tab. `guidelines/security.md` is the short version; ADR 0004 is
  the model.
- **Idle CPU is zero and must stay zero.** The process blocks in one place: the platform event wait.
- Every `src/` directory has a `MODULE.deps` contract enforced by the architecture lint. Read the
  manifest before adding a file, an include, or a class member.
- `AGENTS.md` owns repo policy. `guidelines/` owns the durable how-to. `docs/adr/` owns decisions.
- Build with `cmake`, test with `ctest`, and prefer `tools/run-checks.sh` so results are readable
  afterward without rerunning.

## Project Status

**The browser renders real pages.** `./build/microbrowser/microbrowser <url>` fetches a document,
parses it, resolves its cascade, lays it out, and draws it — text included. What exists:

| Module | State |
|---|---|
| `src/util` | Parse, StringUtil, Env, tracing, counters, DEFLATE |
| `src/gfx` | Geometry, transforms, Color, Canvas, DirtyRegion, DisplayList + its two-frame diff, Path, analytic-AA rasterizer, stroker, Painter, FreeType/HarfBuzz text, font catalog, glyph and shaped-run caches, PNG, bilinear image scaling. SDL-free. |
| `src/ipc` | Typed, versioned, serializable UI↔Engine messages, including display lists with text on them |
| `src/url` | WHATWG URL parser, Origin, Site, PartitionKey, public-suffix list |
| `src/privacy` | Blocking engine, HTTPS-only, referrer trimming, tracking-parameter removal, Verdict |
| `src/net` | HTTP/1.1, cookies, cache, sockets, TLS. `Fetch` takes a `privacy::Verdict` and has no overload without one. |
| `src/dom` | Node, Element, Text, Document |
| `src/html` | Spec-literal tokenizer and tree construction |
| `src/css` | Tokenizer, parser, selectors, cascade, computed style, user-agent sheet |
| `src/layout` | Box tree, block box model, line boxes with a shared baseline, line breaking, per-line text fragments, replaced elements, floats and clearance, display-list building |
| `src/engine` | Page (one document), Loader (everything network), Engine (routes messages) |
| `src/platform` | The only module that knows what a window is. SDL and the system font database live here. |
| `src/app` | Main loop: idle-wait policy, bounded event drain, dirty-region policy, present |

Not yet started: flexbox and grid (rest of M5), stacking contexts (rest of M6), `ui` (M7, including
the process split and sandbox), `js` (M8), integration (M9). Loading is synchronous — the loop blocks
for the length of a fetch — and a display list carrying an image serializes the bitmap inline rather
than naming it in a resource table. Roadmap in `README.md` and `AGENTS.md`.

## Development Workflow

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)

# Inner loop: test binary only.
cmake --build build --target microbrowser_tests -j$(nproc)

# Full suite, sharded across cores.
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -j$(nproc)

# Benchmarks. Only built under the perf preset, and the binary refuses to print
# timings from a build without NDEBUG.
cmake --preset microbrowser-perf && cmake --build --preset microbrowser-perf --target microbrowser_bench
./build/microbrowser-perf/microbrowser/microbrowser_bench blit

# Focused, by substring.
./build/microbrowser/microbrowser_tests Canvas
./build/microbrowser/microbrowser_tests ArchitectureInvariants
./build/microbrowser/microbrowser_tests --list
```

The build auto-uses **ccache** and **ld.lld** when present; both are no-ops if absent.

Prefer the logging wrapper — it tees to a deterministic file so a result can be read back instead of
rerunning:

```bash
tools/run-checks.sh tests   # -> /tmp/microbrowser-tests.log
tools/run-checks.sh asan    # -> /tmp/microbrowser-asan.log
tools/run-checks.sh ubsan   # -> /tmp/microbrowser-ubsan.log
tools/run-checks.sh tsan    # -> /tmp/microbrowser-tsan.log
tools/run-checks.sh all
```

**After a run, READ `/tmp/microbrowser-<target>.log` instead of rebuilding and rerunning.**

TSan needs ASLR cleared (`setarch -R`); `run-checks.sh` does this automatically. Running `ctest` on
the tsan preset by hand without it fails with "unexpected memory mapping" — that is the environment,
not a bug.

## Observability

All off by default, all read once on first use:

```bash
MICROBROWSER_PERF_COUNTERS=1   # non-zero event counters, dumped at exit
MICROBROWSER_PERF_SUMMARY=1    # per-label scope table ranked by self time
MICROBROWSER_PERF_TRACE=1      # one stderr line per scope (a firehose; distorts what it measures)
MICROBROWSER_STARTUP_SUMMARY=1 # same, for startup scopes
MICROBROWSER_TRACE_REDRAW=1    # one line per presented frame: full/partial, rects, coverage
```

**Read the main-thread column of a summary first.** Self time ranks CPU cost; main time ranks what
the user waits on, and the two routinely disagree. See `guidelines/observability.md`.

## Before You Add Anything

- **A new file** — check the module's `max_tu_lines` and whether the file belongs in this module at
  all. A file that does not fit the module's `purpose:` line wants a different module.
- **A new include** — check `allow:` and the target module's `public:`. If the header you want is
  private, decide whether it should be published or whether you are reaching across a boundary.
- **A class member or public method** — check the class's `budget:`. If you must raise it, say why
  in the commit message. That is the mechanism working, not a hoop.
- **A third-party dependency** — write an ADR. `docs/adr/0001-third-party-dependencies.md` lists the
  sanctioned set and why each earns its place.
- **A timer, poll, or background wakeup** — justify it against the zero-idle-CPU invariant, and
  route it through `IdleWaitState::next_deadline_ms`.
- **A network request** — it must be user-caused and must pass the privacy layer. See
  `guidelines/privacy.md`.
- **A parser, a decoder, or an IPC message** — the input is hostile. Bounds-check every read,
  saturate every size computed from input, and land the fuzz target on the same commit. See
  `guidelines/security.md`.
- **A thread** — write down what it owns, what it borrows, and who joins it before `main` returns.

`tools/budget-report.sh` prints headroom against every budget, sorted by how close each is to its
limit. Run it before a refactor to see what is about to blow.

## Agent Best Practices

- Narrow the problem with fast repo inspection: `rg`, `rg --files`, targeted reads. Avoid broad dumps.
- Match the repo's design direction instead of preserving stale boundaries. Broad refactors are fine
  when they improve correctness or ownership.
- Prefer RAII, explicit ownership, value semantics. Inheritance only for a durable polymorphic
  boundary (`ipc::Transport` is one; most things are not).
- Keep deterministic logic out of event glue and paint code — that is what makes it testable.
- Treat performance as measurable engineering. Do not guess; the counters and scopes are there.
- When a lint fires, fix the design it is pointing at. Raising a budget to silence it is sometimes
  right, but it should be a decision, not a reflex.
